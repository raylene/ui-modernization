# Summary

* Prompted chat in which users are guided through a series of pre-defined questions and answers is likely to be most effective, but whatever chat type you use: make sure to set users' expectations up front.
* Accessibility is a key consideration for chat experiences and should be incorporated from the beginning of the process.
* Use data to inform the initial set up of your chat experience, and make sure to have data collection in place to iterate and improve over time.
* Your system should handle 15-20 questions or scenarios very well and have clear paths for people to find more information on other topics.
